    <p>
        Graduated from The University of Northampton where I developed a passion for Web Development.
        I learnt to be an outstanding problem solver which helps me tackle business problems using a variety of different programming languages and softwares.
        Such as HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and SQL.

    <h2>Interest</h2>
    <p>Away from the computer screen, one of my main interest is playing football. 
    I currently play and train with a 7 aside football team, doing this I am able to keep fit and maintain my day to day living. 
    I love to meet new people from different backgrounds and cultures as I find it fascinating to learn about others lifestyles and cultural diversity. 
    I have a passion for driving. I love driving, going out for a drive mainly just to clear my head. 
    Lastly, I am currently taking an interest in politics.</p>
