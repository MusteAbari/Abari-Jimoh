      <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Studied Computing at The University of Northampton, 
          where I learnt to be an outstanding problem solver with excellent communication skills. 
          I developed a passion for, coding, designing, maintaining software as well as developing systems and networks 
          by applying software engineering principles to numerous university projects. 
          Alongside my studies I have found time to build my knowledge and experience 
          by developing java programs and creating websites for friends who are starting their businesses.

        Your website speaks highly about your business as it is the first engagement 
        a potential customer sees and it gives them an initial impression about your company. 
        The purpose of a website is to give your brand an online presence allowing users to see your products and services, 
        in addition, it also gives users a chance to communicate with your company.<br>
        <br><br>
        With my experience creating websites I aim to give your company that online exposure it deserves. 
        Each site I create is tailor-made specifically for you, so it brings out the unique personality of your company.

      <h2>Interest</h2>
      <p>Away from the computer screen, one of my main interest is playing football. 
         I currently play for a 7 aside football team, doing this I am able to keep fit and maintain my day to day living. 
         I love to meet new people from different backgrounds as I find it fascinating to learn about the cultures of others. 
         I love driving, going out for a drive on the open road just to clear my head is a passion of mine. 
         Lastly, I am currently developing an interest in politics.
